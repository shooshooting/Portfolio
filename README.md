# Shuting Lin's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio!
I am currently a Manufacturing & Automation Engineer at Foxconn, where I build data-driven systems for production analysis, automation workflows, and real-time decision support. My work bridges manufacturing operations, data analytics, and software tooling, with a focus on improving throughput, visibility, and process reliability across complex production lines.

While this portfolio includes past projects across supply chain, finance, and machine learning, my recent work centers on:

✅ Manufacturing Analytics & Production Insights
✅ Factory Data Integration & Pipeline Design
✅ Flask-based API Services for Production Machines
✅ Dashboard & UI Development for Industrial Operations
✅ Automation System Integration (WMS/WCS/MES/SAP/AGV/ASRS)

I am currently pursuing roles in Data Analytics, Manufacturing Analytics, Supply Chain Analytics, Industrial Data Engineering, and Technical Product roles in data-intensive environments.

🧩 Recent Foxconn Work — Production + Analytics + Automation
1. Production Data Pipeline & Flask API Services

Description:
Designed lightweight Flask APIs for machine data ingestion (screw machines, PCM, SPEA, TI inspections), integrating CSV/Log data into internal data lakes for real-time analysis.

Skills & Tools:
Python · Flask · CSV/Logs ingestion · SQLite · APIs · ETL

Highlights:

Enabled automated inspection data collection instead of manual export

Reduced troubleshooting time on defected SNs & production blockers

Provided data foundation for downstream risk & correlation models

2. Production Analytics Dashboard + UI

Description:
Built a factory-facing analytics dashboard (HTML/CSS/JS + Flask backend) for multiple stakeholders including production planners, industrial engineers, quality, and management.

Use Cases:

Batch traceability (SN-level)

TI/PCM correlation insights

OTD Risk visualization

Bottleneck identification (UPH, yield, downtime)

Investigation workflows (bad units, inspection failures)

Skills & Tools:
Python Flask HTML/CSS/JS Plotly Jinja Manufacturing Data

Outcome:
Improved visibility across multiple product lines & scheduling decisions.
